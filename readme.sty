Ok thanks for sharing and do we need to keep same design or we can use some Astro template design ?

LT

Leo Turbet-Delof 6:44 PM
 
Same design

Atul Sood 6:46 PM
 
As I can see this website is having lots of blog posts. Do you have exact number of blog posts?
 
and Pages.

In Astro we need to create these .md files for all and then implement template desing to it.
 
Ok in this case, I think 5-6 days will work
 
and will cost you around $575

Leo Turbet-Delof 6:54 PM
 
Ok, i could be interested

Atul Sood 6:55 PM
 
Ok thanks!
 
You can hire me here, and I can start working on it from Monday morning.
 
And I need your wordpress login details as well.

Leo Turbet-Delof 7:00 PM
 
Exactly same design possible ?
 
I’ll Check on Astra template
 
If we can have better design

Atul Sood 7:05 PM
 
Yes, it will not be exactly the same but if you want then I will try to make it match. Else we can go with some templates as well from Astro.

Leo Turbet-Delof 7:20 PM
 
Hmm seems not really adapted to us
 
Leo Turbet-Delof 11:56 PM
 
Can you send me your detailled approach ?
 
To validate it with the team

Phase 1: Exporting Content (Export WP data to Markdown files; host for free on Vercel/Netlify)

Phase 2: Setting up the Astro Project

Phase 3: Building the UI

Phase 4: Handling SEO & Redirects

Phase 5: Deployment
 
 
These will be the steps that are needed to create a full static setup with Astro.
 
Leo Turbet-Delof 10:52 PM
 
Thanks for outlining your initial plan.
 
 
The overall direction makes sense for a basic static setup with Astro, however for this specific project (high-traffic recipe site with rich results and ads), I see some critical risks in the current sequencing that I’d like us to address before execution.
 
 
Below is a constructive review and a proposed adjustment to better protect SEO, rich results, and monetization.
 
 
Feedback on the initial plan

Phase 1 — Exporting WP data to Markdown
 
 
This is the main concern.
 
 
For standard editorial content, Markdown export is fine.

However, for recipes (currently powered by WP Recipe Maker), exporting early without a frozen target data model introduces risk:
 
 
WPRM is not just content, it’s a structured data system (Recipe schema / JSON-LD).
 
 
Exporting before defining the target recipe schema can lead to:
 
 
missing or flattened fields,
 
 
multiple re-exports,
 
 
SEO regressions (rich results).
 
 
Conclusion: export should be schema-driven, not the starting point.
 
 
Phase 3 → Phase 4 (UI before SEO)
 
 
For a recipe site monetized with ads, SEO and structured data cannot be treated as a late phase.
 
 
If UI is built before:
 
 
heading hierarchy,
 
 
canonical rules,
 
 
pagination strategy,
 
 
Recipe JSON-LD structure,
 
 
image requirements for rich results,
 
 
then markup will likely need rework later.
 
 
Conclusion: SEO and schema need to be defined at the architecture level, not post-UI.
 
 
“Free hosting” during early phases
 
 
Free tiers (Vercel/Netlify) are perfectly fine for staging, but we should clearly separate:
 
 
staging (free / temporary),
 
 
production (defined early, with limits understood).
 
 
This avoids surprises around build limits, bandwidth, or ads later.
 
 
Proposed adjusted plan (SEO-first, risk-driven)
 
 
This is not a major scope increase — it’s a re-ordering to reduce rework and protect the business.
 
 
Phase 0 — Decisions & Freeze (very short)
 
 
Hosting (prod vs staging)
 
 
CMS choice
 
 
Image strategy
 
 
URL structure (frozen)
 
 
Ads & consent constraints
 
 
Deliverable: short architecture decision summary.
 
 
Phase 1 — Data Model & SEO Baseline (before any export)
 
 
Define target models:
 
 
post (editorial)
 
 
recipe (WPRM replacement)
 
 
seo
 
 
Define:
 
 
Recipe Schema.org JSON-LD structure
 
 
Canonical & pagination rules
 
 
Sitemap / robots rules
 
 
Map WPRM fields → target recipe model
 
 
Deliverable: schema + SEO spec.
 
 
Phase 2 — Schema-Driven Export
 
 
Export WP content according to the defined schema
 
 
Migrate a limited sample first (e.g. 50–100 recipes)
 
 
Validate data completeness and edge cases
 
 
Deliverable: migration scripts + test dataset.
 
 
Phase 3 — Astro Skeleton + SEO Plumbing
 
 
Astro project setup
 
 
Routing with preserved URLs
 
 
Global SEO component
 
 
Recipe JSON-LD injection
 
 
Sitemap / robots
 
 
Redirect framework
 
 
At this stage, the site can be visually rough — correctness matters more than polish.
 
 
Phase 4 — UI Build
 
 
Reproduce existing design with minor UX improvements
 
 
Recipe layout, editorial content, sidebar
 
 
Responsive + print styles
 
 
Minimal JS
 
 
Phase 5 — Ads, Tracking & Consent
 
 
Mediavine integration
 
 
CMP
 
 
Analytics
 
 
ads.txt validation
 
 
Phase 6 — Deployment & Validation
 
 
Crawl staging
 
 
Rich Results tests
 
 
Redirect validation
 
 
Go-live + monitoring
 
 
Why this matters
 
 
This sequencing:
 
 
avoids double work,
 
 
protects recipe rich results,
 
 
reduces post-launch SEO risk,
 
 
keeps UI work aligned with real markup constraints.
 
 
The end result is the same static Astro setup — just safer and more predictable.
 
 
Happy to align on this and adjust together, but I wanted to flag these points early rather than discovering issues late in the process.
 
 
Best regards,

Léo Turbet-Delof

Hi Leo Turbet-Delof,
 
 
Thanks for sharing the details. I have checked the backend of the website and I see that there is lots of data to migrate. This website is also having multilanguage so do we need to maintain that as well ? Becasue multilanguage data is seperate there in system. So let me know if we need to maintain the same languages as well or not?

With multiple languages we have around 5316 articles in it, 199 pages, 1,989 recipes, and lots of Taxonomies under recipes.
 
 
Some pages are design with Elementor builder and some are with WP Bakeyr builder so while milgration is data it will not show correct and show show chortcodes where it needs to do manual.
 
 
Also, you mentioned to maintain the JSON-LD for all data. But when we export the data from wordpress website it does not give JSON-LD data in export as this data is created by plugins like Yoast SEO or Rank Maths plugin in wordpress. So when we will use this data in Asto it does not have it in default so we need to put it there and generate dynamically with page content. So, it may be differ with the wordpress website that you are having for now.
 
 
So the time I thought would not work as here much more work to do as expected. I want to make it clear in begining so we all remain on the same page. I hope you understand.
 
 
And sure will go with the plan you have suggested and will let you the base framework that we will have from start.
 
 
Thanks!

How much do you think it will cost ?
 
Yes, we would need to maintain languageds
 
Using IA to migrate this quite easy ?
 
I can do this by myself if you're do the structure

Many pages are useless
 
There's 10 pages to keep
